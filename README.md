# Diabetes-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression

Project Overview
This project develops a logistic regression model to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health metrics such as age, BMI, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health indicators. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports.
Key Steps

    Data Preparation:
        Loaded and cleaned the dataset, removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
        Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.

    Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of key variables, including BMI categories and health metrics.
        Visualized data using box plots and bar charts to highlight distributions and relationships.

    Correlation Analysis:
        Analyzed correlations between health metrics and the diabetes class to identify significant relationships.
        Noted that factors like age, BMI, and HbA1c levels showed strong correlations with diabetes risk.

    Model Development:
        Developed a logistic regression model to predict diabetes risk.
        Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports, yielding high precision and recall for diabetes predictions.

    Model Evaluation:
        Generated a confusion matrix showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
        Created a classification report detailing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

Findings

    The model achieved an accuracy of 95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting diabetes risk.
    Significant correlations were found between various health metrics and diabetes risk, emphasizing the importance of these factors in health assessments.

Implications

This project underscores the value of data-driven approaches in healthcare, providing insights that can inform health risk assessments and interventions for diabetes management.
